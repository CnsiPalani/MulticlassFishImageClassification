# Project Overview

This project is a multiclass fish image classification system using deep learning. It includes:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Training with custom CNN and transfer learning models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Interactive Streamlit web app for predictions and metrics

## Main Features
- Automated data pipeline
- Multiple model architectures (CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0)
- Visualizations: training history, confusion matrices, metric grids
- User-friendly web interface

## Folder Structure
